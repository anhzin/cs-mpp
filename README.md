MSCS @ Maharishi - MPP course

## UML

UML Diagrams are created with [starUML](http://staruml.io/), and exported using [XMI extension](https://github.com/staruml/XMI), then exported to PNG to be included in the lab document.

## Documents

All documents are written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and stored for versioning in that format, then converted to PDF using a MDtoPDF [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf)
